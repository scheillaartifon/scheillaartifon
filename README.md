# Hello! Welcome! My name is Scheilla 🌿🥊🏋🥎

## A little about me ✌️
👩🏻‍💻 My journey in programming started with building websites, turning designs into code with precision. Since then, my passion for front-end has only grown, but over time I’ve become a full stack developer, always looking to learn new technologies that challenge me and remind me why I love programming. Recently, I faced the challenge of configuring and deploying an application on Google Cloud, which expanded my understanding of infrastructure and deployment.

🎨 Additionally, I am a UX Designer and continue to explore this fascinating field, which not only improves my daily work but also enriches the way I see the interaction between technology and the user.

## About my current work 💻
🚀 Full-Stack Web Developer at Cfaz.net, a radiology system, where I’m responsible for resolving bugs, implementing improvements, and ensuring an excellent user experience. In addition to picking cards from the development queue, I also collaborate with colleagues on research to identify improvements and optimize the system.

🔍 I use tools like Hotjar to analyze if the features meet objectives and if users can easily perform the desired actions.

📱 I’m also the main person responsible for Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) that I publish on the Google and Apple stores, ensuring the best performance and user experience.

## What I’m currently studying 📚
🎓 Last year of my degree in Systems Analysis and Development at PUCPR.

📚 This year, my goal is to read Clean Code to further enhance my programming skills and improve the quality of the code I write.

🔧 In addition, I am taking a Vue course to expand my knowledge in front-end development and stay up-to-date with best practices.
